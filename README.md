# -Bank-Account-Interest-Calculation
This PHP script defines a compteBancaire class with methods to get the current balance and calculate the balance after 10 years of applying an annual interest rate. Two instances of the class are created with different initial amounts and interest rates, and their final balances after 10 years are displayed.
